## About This Project

This project consists of 2 main parts, show resume on _Home page_ and show your own articles at _Post page_

I want to have a base so I could start iterating on the features

### Prerequisites

This project start from **Next.js** and **React**, and has some base lint rule (eslint and commitlint), so the development may need to pay attention to

## Usage

After you have cloned, there are a few things you must do

- Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

- Start this project

```bash
yarn run dev
```

- If you just want to see the UI, you can find him through **storybook**

```bash
yarn run storybook
```

## Project structure

My folder structure is separated by feature, as the project is still small, so I want to avoid over-design.

```shell

â”œâ”€ .asset                                   #  docs asset
